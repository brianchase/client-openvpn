# vpn-client

## ABOUT

This Bash script helps with managing
[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
connections with [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/).

## PORTABILITY

Since the script uses arrays, it's not strictly
[POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)-compliant. As a result,
it isn't compatible with
[Dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/) and probably a good
number of other shells.
